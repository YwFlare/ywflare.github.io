# ðŸ¤µ Biography

Hello! This is Weifeng Yuan (è‹‘ä¼Ÿé”‹). I graduated from the Department of Computer Science, Nankai University with a bachelorâ€™s degree. I delved into entrepreneurship and ventured into various businesses during university. Now I am the CEO of Tianjin Fengshuo Technology Co., Ltd. I am driven by two core objectives: firstly, to make significant contributions in cutting-edge scientific and technological fields; and secondly, to lead a community towards prosperity and wealth. Here is my [CV](http://ywflare.github.io/files/CV_WeifengYuan.pdf).

My research interest includes semantic segmentation, action segmentation and attention mechanisms. My graduation thesis, supervised by Dr. [Qibin Hou](https://houqb.github.io/), is focused on mutil-sacle attention in action segmentation. Excitingly, a paper on Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation is in preparation.

In addition, I am an sports enthusiast and running is my favorite activity. I participate in several half marathons every year. I am also a skilled swimmer and have recently been learning how to play badminton.
